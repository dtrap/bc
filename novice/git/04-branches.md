####Learning Branching

#####Branches defined: 

* Branching is a way for you to create a new working copy of a project without affecting the main project.

#####Benefits of branching:

* You can change a project radically and save it, but always have the ability to switch back to your stable copy.
* Other people or collaborators can modify the project without affecting the main project. 

**As an individual:**

While `mars.txt` is great for Dracula and Mummy, Wolfman is having a hard time with all the changes. The two moons are really cramping his style! He decides to fix the problem by proposing `shelter.txt`

Follow along by typing the following into your terminal: 

<div class="in" markdown="1">
~~~
$ Touch shelter.txt

$ Nano shelter.txt
~~~
</div>

**Copy and Paste the following into shelter.txt:**

<div class="in" markdown="1">
~~~
Bedrooms:
3

* For Dracula: Coffin 7x4
* For Mummy: Sarcaphogus 7x4 
* For me: Bedroom with no windows 30x30
~~~
</div>
