So, we just covered how we can resolve conflicting changes but what if we are renegades? What if what we want is to maintain both changes that were made, i.e. keeping the conflicts?

Well we can't leave the conflict as is, because as we saw previously we won't be able to push our changes and save both versions of the same file due to the conflict. There is a way around this, though. We can make something called a branch! We are, in fact, branching out from our site of conflict to make two different versions of the same file or repo!

There are lots of reasons we would want to do this. We might want to keep two versions of a file and decide later which one is better. We might also have a collaborator we are working with and the two of us want to try different approaches to the same end. By creating another branch, we can play around with our progress without changing the master file or repository. Then if our branch is the best, we can merge the branch using a pull request. Branches help us decide what versions are preferable and give us a way of assesing alterantive options!

Sweet, huh?

Alright, let's BRANCH OUT!
